These models have demonstrated remarkable performance in a wide range of natural\\nlanguage processing tasks, but their increasing size has posed challenges for deployment and raised\\nconcerns about their environmental and economic impact due to high energy consumption. One\\napproach to address these challenges is to use post-training quantization to create low-bit models\\nfor inference [XLS+23, FAHA23, CCKS23, TCS+24]. This technique reduces the precision of\\nweights and activations, significantly reducing the memory and computational requirements of LLMs.\\nThe trend has been to move from 16 bits to lower bits, such as 4-bit variants [FAHA23, LTT+23].\\nHowever, post-training quantization is sub-optimal, even though it is widely used in industry LLMs.\\nRecent work on 1-bit model architectures, such as BitNet [WMD+23], presents a promising direction\\nfor reducing the cost of LLMs while maintaining their performance. Vanilla LLMs are in 16-bit\\nfloating values (i.e., FP16 or BF16), and the bulk of any LLMs is matrix multiplication. Therefore,\\nthe major computation cost comes from the floating-point addition and multiplication operations. In\\ncontrast, the matrix multiplication of BitNet only involves integer addition, which saves orders of\\nenergy cost for LLMs. As the fundamental limit to compute performance in many chips is power, the\\nenergy savings can also be translated into faster computation.\\nIn addition to computation, the process of transferring model parameters from DRAM to the memory\\nof an on-chip accelerator (e.g., SRAM) can be expensive during inference. There have been attempts\\nto enlarge SRAM to improve throughput, but this introduces significantly higher costs than DRAM.\\nCompared to full-precision models, 1-bit LLMs have a much lower memory footprint from both a\\ncapacity and bandwidth standpoint. This can significantly reduce the cost and time of loading weights\\nfrom DRAM, leading to faster and more efficient inference.\\nIn this work, we introduce a significant 1-bit LLM variant called BitNet b1.58, where every parameter\\nis ternary, taking on values of {-1, 0, 1}. We have added an additional value of 0 to the original 1-bit\\nBitNet, resulting in 1.58 bits in the binary system. BitNet b1.58 retains all the benefits of the original\\n1-bit BitNet, including its new computation paradigm, which requires almost no multiplication\\noperations for matrix multiplication and can be highly optimized. Additionally, it has the same energy\\nconsumption as the original 1-bit BitNet and is much more efficient in terms of memory consumption,\\nthroughput and latency compared to FP16 LLM baselines. Furthermore, BitNet b1.58 offers two\\nadditional advantages. Firstly, its modeling capability is stronger due to its explicit support for feature\\nfiltering, made possible by the inclusion of 0 in the model weights, which can significantly improve\\nthe performance of 1-bit LLMs. Secondly, our experiments show that BitNet b1.58 can match full\\nprecision (i.e., FP16) baselines in terms of both perplexity and end-task performance, starting from a\\n3B size, when using the same configuration (e.g., model size, training tokens, etc.).\\n2\\nBitNet b1.58\\nBitNet b1.58 is based on the BitNet architecture, which is a Transformer that replaces nn.Linear with\\nBitLinear. It is trained from scratch, with 1.58-bit weights and 8-bit activations. Compared to the\\noriginal BitNet, it introduces some modifications that we summarize below.\\nQuantization Function.\\nTo constrain the weights to -1, 0, or +1, we adopt an absmean quantization\\nfunction. It first scales the weight matrix by its average absolute value, and then round each value to\\nthe nearest integer among {-1, 0, +1}:\\nf\\nW = RoundClip( W\\nγ + ϵ, −1, 1),\\n(1)\\nRoundClip(x, a, b) = max(a, min(b, round(x))),\\n(2)\\nγ =\\n1\\nnm\\nX\\nij\\n|Wij|.\\n(3)\\nThe quantization function for activations follows the same implementation in BitNet, except that\\nwe do not scale the activations before the non-linear functions to the range [0, Qb].

In this way, BitNet b1.58\\ncan be integrated into the popular open-source software (e.g., Huggingface, vLLM [KLZ+23], and\\nllama.cpp2) with minimal efforts.\\n3\\nResults\\nWe compared BitNet b1.58 to our reproduced FP16 LLaMA LLM in various sizes. To ensure a fair\\ncomparison, we pre-trained the models on the RedPajama dataset [Com23] for 100 billion tokens.\\nWe evaluated the zero-shot performance on a range of language tasks, including ARC-Easy [YBS19],\\nARC-Challenge [YBS19], Hellaswag [ZHB+19], Winogrande [SBBC20], PIQA [BZB+19], Open-\\nbookQA [MCKS18], and BoolQ [CLC+19]. We also reported the validation perplexity on the\\nWikiText2 [MXBS16] and C4 [RSR+19] datasets.\\nWe compared the runtime GPU memory and latency of both LLaMA LLM and BitNet b1.58. The\\nresults were measured using the FasterTransformer3 codebase, which is well-optimized for LLM\\ninference latency on GPU devices. The 2-bit kernel from Ladder [WMC+23] is also integrated for\\nBitNet b1.58. We reported the time per output token, as it is the major cost for inference.\\nTable 1 summarizes the perplexity and the cost for BitNet b1.58 and LLaMA LLM. It shows that\\nBitNet b1.58 starts to match full precision LLaMA LLM at 3B model size in terms of perplexity,\\nwhile being 2.71 times faster and using 3.55 times less GPU memory. In particular, BitNet b1.58 with\\na 3.9B model size is 2.4 times faster, consumes 3.32 times less memory, but performs significantly\\nbetter than LLaMA LLM 3B.\\n2https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp\\n3https://github.com/NVIDIA/FasterTransformer\\n3'),\n",

We followed the pipeline\\nfrom lm-evaluation-harness4 to perform the evaluation. The results show that the performance gap\\nbetween BitNet b1.58 and LLaMA LLM narrows as the model size increases. More importantly,\\nBitNet b1.58 can match the performance of the full precision baseline starting from a 3B size. Similar\\nto the observation of the perplexity, the end-task results reveal that BitNet b1.58 3.9B outperforms\\nLLaMA LLM 3B with lower memory and latency cost. This demonstrates that BitNet b1.58 is a\\nPareto improvement over the state-of-the-art LLM models.\\nMemory and Latency\\nWe further scaled up the model size to 7B, 13B, and 70B and evaluated the\\ncost. Figure 2 illustrates the trends of latency and memory, showing that the speed-up increases as the\\nmodel size scales. In particular, BitNet b1.58 70B is 4.1 times faster than the LLaMA LLM baseline.\\nThis is because the time cost for nn.Linear grows with the model size. The memory consumption\\nfollows a similar trend, as the embedding remains full precision and its memory proportion is smaller\\nfor larger models. Both latency and memory were measured with a 2-bit kernel, so there is still room\\nfor optimization to further reduce the cost.\\nEnergy\\nWe also estimate the arithmetic operations energy consumption of both BitNet b1.58 and\\nLLaMA LLM. We focus mainly on the calculation for matrix multiplication, since it contributes\\nthe most to the cost of LLMs. Figure 3 illustrates the composition of the energy cost. The majority\\nof BitNet b1.58 is INT8 addition calculation, while LLaMA LLM consists of both FP16 addition\\nand FP16 multiplication. According to the energy model in [Hor14, ZZL22], BitNet b1.58 saves\\n71.4 times arithmetic operations energy consumption for matrix multiplication on 7nm chips. We\\nfurther reported the end-to-end energy cost for models with 512 tokens. Our results show that as the\\nmodel size scales, BitNet b1.58 becomes increasingly more efficient in terms of energy consumption\\ncompared to the FP16 LLaMA LLM baseline. This is due to the fact that the percentage of nn.Linear\\ngrows with the model size, while the cost from other components is smaller for larger models.\\nThroughput\\nWe compare the throughput of BitNet b1.58 and LLaMA LLM with 70B parameters\\non two 80GB A100 cards, using pipeline parallelism [HCB+19] so that LLaMA LLM 70B could be\\nrun on the devices. We increased the batch size until the GPU memory limit was reached, with a\\nsequence length of 512. Table 3 shows that BitNet b1.58 70B can support up to 11 times the batch\\nsize of LLaMA LLM, resulting an 8.9 times higher throughput.\\n4https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness\\n4'),\n",

Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsigniﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [18] and conditional\\ncomputation [26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 16]. In all but a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [11]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1\\nEncoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:\\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers.

On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the ﬁnal values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = Pdk\\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\\n4'),\n",

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[31, 2, 8].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4\\nEmbeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n3.5\\nPositional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\n5'),\n",

The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed.

That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any ﬁxed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [8] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [11]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[31] and byte-pair [25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\n6'),\n",

This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [15], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side beneﬁt, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5\\nTraining\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1\\nTraining Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signiﬁcantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [31]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2\\nHardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3\\nOptimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [17] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)\\n(3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the ﬁrst warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4\\nRegularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\nResidual Dropout\\nWe apply dropout [27] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\n7'),\n",
